## üèóÔ∏è Development

1. Install and initialize poetry and install `pre-commit` hooks:

```bash
make install
make pre-commit-install
```

2. Run the codestyle:

```bash
make codestyle
```

### Makefile usage

[`Makefile`](https://github.com/ezhang7423/%7B%7Bresearch\_project%7D%7D/blob/master/Makefile) contains a lot of functions for faster development.

<details>

<summary>1. Download and remove Poetry</summary>

To download and install Poetry run:

```bash

```

To uninstall

```

</details>

<summary>3. Codestyle</summary>

Automatic formatting uses `pyupgrade`, `isort` and `black`.

```bash
make codestyle

# or use synonym
make formatting
```

Codestyle checks only, without rewriting files:

```bash
make check-codestyle
```

Note: `check-codestyle` uses `isort`, `black` and `darglint` library

<summary>6. Tests with coverage badges</summary>

Run `pytest`

make test
```

</details>

<details>

<summary>7. All linters</summary>

Of course there is a command to ~~rule~~ run all linters in one:

```bash
make lint
```

the same as:

```bash
make test && make check-codestyle && make mypy && make check-safety
```

</details>

<details>

<summary>8. Docker</summary>

```bash
make docker-build
```

which is equivalent to:

```bash
make docker-build VERSION=latest
